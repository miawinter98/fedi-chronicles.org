  "description": "The 5th September 2014 was the day the first sketch of the ActivityPump protocol was pushed onto GitHub. It would later be refined into a draft that would be submitted to the Social Web Working Group and go on to become the foundation of the ActivityPub protocol. Many view this as the Birtday of the AP protocol."
